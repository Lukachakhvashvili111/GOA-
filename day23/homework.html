            <h3>i also want to type about my favorite type of bear,polar bears</h3>
            <p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. 
                  It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant 
                  species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species are size
                   dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a 
                   thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder
                    hump. Its teeth are sharper and mor
                  e adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.</p>
            <p>they're going extinct but as long as theyre not extinct they're my favorite kind of bears,they're scary but if you
                  were stuck in a freezing cold place with no food you would probably be angry too
            </p>
